r/AmITheAsshole is a popular forum on the website Reddit with a current subscriber
count of 3.4 million. This subreddit is a place where people go to tell their stories, and to get an
unbiased opinion on it. As the name of the subreddit so clearly states, they are looking to find out
if they are the asshole of their story. Once a user posts their story to the subreddit, other users
will respond with their input on the situation and whether or not the author is the storyâ€™s asshole
or not. Based on these responses and the upvotes these responses get, the author is labeled as the
asshole, not the asshole or several other titles. My quest in this analysis is to create a classifier
and interactable bot to skip the user input and get an instant response. In any situation in which
one seeks to persuade, to evoke an emotional response, to win friends or influence people - it is
essential not to come off as an asshole. Politicians, writers, lawyers, all could use a bot to check
if their written or spoken works could be perceived as assholery. Furthermore, it is often known
that email and text communication often can be misinterpreted due to the lack of tone and body
language information. Being able to automatically check if a piece of written communication
could be interpreted in a negative light before sending it could at the very least help improve
business dealings and, in more dire cases, save business relationships. Here, I seek to build a
model to fill this need, or at the very least take the first steps towards doing so.
